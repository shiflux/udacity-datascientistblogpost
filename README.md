# Project Motivation
This is a project for the Udacity "Data Scientist" nanodegree.
I decided to analise the trend of the salaries from 2011 to 2020 using the surveys data taken from StackOverflow. The focus is on the data coming from Italy: trend of the salaries in Italy and how it fares compared to US and Global trends.

# Results
